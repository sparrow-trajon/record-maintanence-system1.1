# record-maintanence-system1.1

It is very simple Record maintanence system with complete code flow and exception handling and custom log wrapper.
It performs two tasks.

1. Get the data from database....save to the file(CSV file ).
2. Filter out the duplicate data and save the non-duplicate data to the target file-another CSV file.

System.outs-> it print the overwritten data, target File data with sorted id.

Exception Handling -> uses the default exception handling except only one custom class exception handling.
Logger ->             Custom LogWrapper uses LOG4j.
Database ->           Uses JDBC to connect to the server.
